DEFERRED (can decide later):

Should we add scenarios for user management (registration, profile updates)?
Do you want scenarios for search/filtering fights?
Should admins be able to override vote outcomes?
Should there be notifications when tag requests resolve?
should we track team participation in orgs?
do we need an sorg tabless?
