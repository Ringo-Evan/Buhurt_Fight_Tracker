Gave myself an hour this morning and lost half to finally debuging the conda problem. 
.bat file was not in the path, but exe was. Thought that would be enough but guess not. adding bat got CMD working but powershell stil no.
lauching a powershell Anaconda instance could run conda init powershell and though added a webhooks script to start up. But since this is a default user system had to change policy to Restricted.
Anyway working now and container is saving stated from yesterday.

I don't have an updated at variable. Will not need with audit table?
422 instead of 400 for badly format requests. is this correct. check http spec

Overlooked how to un delete a country apparently
Is_deleted is currently being checked for conflict on patch and postgres
Getting by code fails if country not found. There is no try catch(Should all gets go through a base get method? into the repo? That feels overly engineered)

Working, Positive path. Checking county code is 3 uppercase letters within spec(do we need to check input if we are checking against spec?)
getting with and without deleted. Conflict checking. Patch only updates the specified fields we want. 404s when country is delted or not reall
