I'm lost on this project atm. Need to better than just taking notes on what happened. Should put goals, results, and plan for next session whether for me or claude.
Will switch back to tickets in a bit I think but really just want to get through this next section of refactor and testing. 

Today will try to add deactivate (and reactivate logic) for as many data types as possible. Will probably not finish, but if I do still need to add hard deletes.
after that check feb2/4th for other bugs.
