Today was just implementing the CI/CD pipeline. Used Sonnet. I spent some time updating the CLUADE.MD to remove some over explination of each phase and included all the phases. Needed to do this since it was missing the updated CI/CD phase. 
After that was pretty easy, just let CLAUDE cook. It took alot of iterations for Claude to get the integration test working. It was a surprise to me that it wrote them in the first place. Possibly I missed an instruction in the PROGRESS.md but might have simply been poisoned context based on the constant refernce to test numbers and also the note about forgetting integration tests. Per usual it wrote them all at once. It solved all the issues itself apparently. I still haven't had time to do more than surface testing or code review. Possibly spend the entire next session doing that.
There was a minor hiccup in that Claude doesn't have access to push to my repo from sandbox. I'm not sure why, since I believe I set it up to allow claude pushes. Need to investigate. I did a risky option of creating an SHH key and letting it sign in as me. I'm fairly certain that should be isolated to this session but I'm slightly worried it will persist somehow. I need to find a way to give it it's own limited access either via key or token. Will I have to make my own Claude image for this? or is there a better option?

Todays session was just over an hour
