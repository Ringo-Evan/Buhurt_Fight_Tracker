fixed tests. used claude code sonnet 4.5 via vscode. Did alot more reading and planning than needed, but my prompt gave no real context. It's worth spending 5 mins to describe problems in detail and point to the neccesary files.
Claude also wanted to reverse using 400 as the return code for failed custom validation. Perhaps would not if I had left comments or made an ADR. 
Otherwise nothing really worth noting. Only spend 30 minutes.
