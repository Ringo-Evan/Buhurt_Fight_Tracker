Tried to get debug working and ran into some issues. First couldn't get the VS.code launch code set up right to use docker. Need to look into that.
Instead went with the launch specific file and am just running postgres container manually. Then didn't realize that fastapi put swagger at /docs so spent a 15 minutes getting claude to reimplement OpenApi docs.
Claude fucked that up and had to spend some time debuging. 
Then when trying to set up the initial migration for the db, had to install a dependency that was somehow not included? Added that to the requirements.
Tried to run via postman in browser but Brave blocks network access and the setting to enable that is not where the first few docs said it would be.

Spent an hour today, not doing much. However should be able to just start functional testing next session and write up a more detailed test strategy.
