# ADR-000: Tracking Architecrture Design Review

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Doing a code project with an AI assistant and following its guidelines can seem overkill and silly

## Decision

Create the review docs. 

## Rationale
There's no good reason not to and they are nice tracking. Might actually be useful when looking back or if I need to delay a major decision but want to track it thoughts on it
