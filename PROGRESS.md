---

## What "Portfolio Complete" Means

The project is portfolio-ready when someone can:
1. Clone the repo and run tests (all pass)
2. Read the README and understand the architecture
3. See TDD/BDD discipline in git history
4. Review ADRs and understand design decisions
5. **Hit the live API** at a public URL
6. See test coverage reports (>90%)

**NOT required for portfolio v1:**
- Full tag voting system (deferred to v2)
- User authentication (deferred to v2)
- Frontend (deferred to v3)
- E2E tests with Playwright

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation Entities ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed**: 2026-01-14
**Time**: ~6.5 hours
**Velocity**: 50% faster than estimated

| Entity | Unit Tests | Integration | BDD | API | Migration |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----|-----|-----------|
| Country | 48 | 14 | 21 | ✅ CRUD | ✅ |
| Team | 48 | 15 | 40+ | ✅ CRUD | ✅ |
| Fighter | 34 | 12 | 37 | ✅ CRUD | ✅ |

**Key Achievements**:
- Established TDD patterns (test-first development)
- Repository → Service → API layering proven
- Soft delete pattern working
- Eager loading configured (no N+1)
- UTC datetime handling correct

**Lessons Learned**:
- Pattern reuse accelerates (Fighter 2x faster than Country)
- Comprehensive planning prevents decision paralysis
- NotImplementedError pattern documents blockers clearly

---

### Phase 2A: Tag Foundation 🚧 IN PROGRESS

**Started**: 2026-01-24
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
**Time Spent**: ~2 hours
**Complexity**: Medium (new pattern, but simpler than Fight)
**Prerequisite for**: Phase 2B (Fight needs fight_format tag)

| Entity | Status | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | API | Migration |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----|-----------|
| TagType | ✅ COMPLETE | 19 | 8 | ✅ Full CRUD | ⏸️ Pending |
| Tag | ⏸️ NOT STARTED | 0 | 0 | ❌ | ❌ |

**TagType Key Achievements**:
- Complete CRUD implementation following Phase 1 patterns
- Repository layer: create, get_by_id, get_by_name, list_all, update, soft_delete
- Service layer: Full validation (duplicate names, required fields, 50 char limit)
- API layer: 5 endpoints (POST, GET list, GET by ID, PATCH, DELETE)
- Feature file corrected to match actual model (removed incorrect parent_tag_type hierarchy)
- Integration tests written as specification (not BDD step definitions)
- All 19 unit tests passing (186/191 overall project tests passing)

**TagType Lessons Learned**:
- ⚠️ **TDD Violation**: Wrote all 9 service tests at once instead of strict one-at-a-time RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
- ✅ **Feature File as Spec**: Used Gherkin scenarios as specification for integration tests (cleaner than BDD step defs)
- ✅ **Pattern Reuse**: Repository/Service/API patterns from Phase 1 accelerated implementation

**Why Tags Before Fights?**
Fight validation depends on `fight_format` (singles vs melee):
- Singles: exactly 1 fighter per side
- Melee: minimum 5 fighters per side

Without tags, Fight can't properly validate participant counts.

**Seed Data**:
```
TagType: fight_format (required=true)
Values: "singles", "melee"
```

**Business Rules to Implement**:
- [ ] TagType is reference data (admin-seeded)
- [ ] Tag.value must be valid for its TagType
- [ ] fight_format tag is required (enforced when creating Fight)
- [ ] Only one tag per TagType per Fight (for now)

**Success Criteria**:
- TagType seeding works
- Tag CRUD with validation
- No regressions in Phase 1

---

### Phase 2B: Fight Tracking 📋 PLANNED

**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours
**Complexity**: High (many-to-many, transactions, format-dependent validation)
**Prerequisites**: Phase 2A complete

| Entity | Purpose | Key Complexity |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Fight | Core fight record | Aggregate root pattern |
| FightParticipation | Junction table | Side/role validation, transactions |

**Business Rules to Implement**:
- [ ] Fight must have exactly one fight_format tag (singles or melee)
- [ ] Singles: exactly 1 fighter per side
- [ ] Melee: minimum 5 fighters per side
- [ ] Both sides must have participants
- [ ] No duplicate fighters in same fight
- [ ] Max 1 captain per side
- [ ] Fight date cannot be in future
- [ ] Location is required
- [ ] Fight + Tag + Participations created atomically (single transaction)

**Success Criteria**:
- Transactional fight creation working
- Format-dependent validation working
- API endpoints functional
- No regressions in Phase 1 or 2A

---

### Phase 3: Tag Expansion 📋 PLANNED

**Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours
**Complexity**: Medium (extending existing pattern)
**Prerequisites**: Phase 2B complete

**Scope**: Extend tag system with hierarchy and more tag types

**New TagTypes to Add**:
| TagType | Parent | Required | Values |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| category | fight_format | No | Singles: duel, profight / Melee: 3s, 5s, 10s, etc. |
| gender | none | No | male, female, mixed |
| weapon | category (duel only) | No | longsword, polearm, sword_shield, etc. |
| league | category | No | BI, IMCF, AMMA, etc. |
| custom | none | No | freeform text |

**New Features**:
- [ ] Tag.parent_tag_id for hierarchy
- [ ] Validation: child tags require valid parent
- [ ] Cascading soft delete (change category → delete weapon)
- [ ] Custom tags allow multiple per fight
- [ ] Category-specific allowed values

**Deferred to v2**:
- TagChangeRequest (voting proposals)
- Vote entity
- Community voting workflow
- Session-based fraud prevention

**Success Criteria**:
- Hierarchical tags working
- Cascade delete working
- No regressions

### Phase 4A: Basic Deployment 📋 PLANNED

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
**Focus**: Get API running in cloud

**Stack**:
- Azure App Service (B1 tier, with stop/start scripts)
- Neon PostgreSQL (free tier, serverless)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up Neon account and database
- [ ] Create Azure App Service via portal
- [ ] Configure environment variables (connection strings, secrets)
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
- [ ] Create start/stop shell scripts for cost management
- [ ] Verify API accessible at public URL
- [ ] Add basic health check endpoint

**Cost Strategy**:
- Neon free tier: $0/month
- App Service B1 stopped: $0/month
- App Service B1 running: ~$13/month (prorated by hour)
- **Target**: <$5/month during development

**Success Criteria**:
- API deployed and accessible
- Can stop/start to manage costs
- CI/CD pipeline working
- README updated with deployment info

---

### Phase 4B: Infrastructure as Code 📋 OPTIONAL

**Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours
**Focus**: Reproducible infrastructure

**Stack**:
- Terraform (cloud-agnostic IaC)
- Azure provider
- GitHub Actions for apply/destroy

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Learn Terraform basics
- [ ] Define App Service in Terraform
- [ ] Define resource group, networking
- [ ] Create terraform apply/destroy workflow
- [ ] Document infrastructure in code

**Why Optional**:
- Not required for portfolio
- Can add after Phase 4A if time permits
- Good stretch goal

---

### Phase 5: Auth (v2) 📋 FUTURE

**Not part of v1 scope**

**Learning Goals**:
- OAuth2/OIDC implementation
- JWT handling
- Role-based access control
- Session management

**Features**:
- User registration/login
- Protected endpoints
- Admin vs user roles
- Tag voting (requires auth for fraud prevention)

---

### Phase 6: Frontend (v3) 📋 FUTURE

**Not part of v1 scope**

**Learning Goals**:
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Modern CSS (Tailwind)
- Frontend testing (Jest, RTL, Playwright)
- State management

**Rationale for Deferral**:
- Backend + deployment demonstrates skills
- Frontend adds 40-55 hours
- Auth should come before public frontend (prevent spam)
- Can be separate learning project

## Test Strategy

### Current Coverage

```
Layer          | Unit Tests | Integration | Coverage
---------------|------------|-------------|----------
Models         | implicit   | 41          | 100%
Repositories   | 73         | 41          | 98%+
Services       | 57         | -           | 100%
API            | -          | -           | (via integration)
```

### Testing Philosophy

1. **Unit tests**: Fast, isolated, mock dependencies
2. **Integration tests**: Real database (Testcontainers), verify constraints
3. **BDD scenarios**: Document behavior, run as integration tests
4. **E2E tests**: (future) Full API flows

### TDD Discipline Note

Phase 1 used "test-first development" (batch tests → batch implementation).
Phase 2+ should use stricter TDD (one test → pass → refactor → repeat).

This distinction matters for interview discussions.

## Questions for Future Sessions

- [ ] Should Fighter.team_id be nullable? (independent fighters)
- [ ] Tag hierarchy depth - how much to implement for v1?
- [ ] Integration test execution - Docker setup working?

See `DECISIONS.md` for full question tracking.
