Building a web app to index the buhurt fight videos across various mediums. This is to solve the problem that over the first 20 years of Buhurt's existence there has been no central repository of videos. Videos are uploaded to personal pages, often in long streams including dozens of actual fights. The goal of this is to make it much easier to go and find old fights for refence reasons.
